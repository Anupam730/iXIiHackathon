#Title: Gamifyed Lab for the teachers
#Social Cause: It is always an issue for teachers when they have to conduct the experiment during the covid-19. It is also an issue for students to face on practical exams as they can't get good hands-on-practice. It is a common issue among all students. So to resolve this problem and help the teacher and students like us. I came up with the idea to implement the "Gamifyed Lab for the teachers‚Äù. It is a platform from which teacher can use the video conference app like zoom and share their screen to teacher the experiemnt. By this, the students will be able to practice the electrical circuit connection and along with reading the lab manuals for the corresponding experiments so they will be able to appear on the exams with much more confidence and proper preparation. As the physical lab is not accessible to all the students and concerned teacher at all times so this Gamifyed Lab will help to practice the experiments at their own pace and be prepared by students, and teach by teacher.
